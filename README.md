ðŸ“Œ Description:
EDUNITOR is a smart educational platform developed to make online learning, teaching, and monitoring more effective and efficient. It is designed for colleges and schools to manage everything digitallyâ€”like attendance, tasks, exams, and student activitiesâ€”all in one place.

The system has two main dashboards:

Teacher Dashboard: Helps teachers assign tasks, take attendance, monitor students, conduct online exams, and track performance.

Student Dashboard: Allows students to mark attendance, submit assignments, request leave, and attend live classes.

It also includes a desktop app that captures screenshots, tracks student activity, and ensures they stay focused during exams.
The platform is built with features like real-time monitoring, video conferencing, and smart notifications to improve learning quality and prevent cheating.
